## :desktop_computer: About the app
[MrBuggy6](http://mrbuggy.pl/mrbuggy6) is a tool for managers of the company providing testing services. This piece of software should allow Managers to keep a track of bidding process for new testing projects (called opportunities), maintain current testing projects (called projects), with access to the list of human resources (employees), clients and services provided by the company. This is the first version delivered by developers to tests so it is expected to contains some defects.

## :teacher: About this project
During the project, I was practicing skills related to writing scenarios and test cases, reporting bugs, and creating a test report.
I checked the list of available defects after completing this project to see what defects I had missed and to learn something new.
A total of 9 test scenarios were written, containing 117 test cases and 36 bug reports, as well as a test report.
